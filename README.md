# Cities, Circles, and Cells

![](Animation/Cities_andCells_gif-002.gif)

“Cities, Circles, and Cells” Is a generative art collection inspired by the biological growth process of Physarum slime-mold. Originally codified as a generative art script by Antonio Sánchez Chinchón in his [“Abstractions”](https://github.com/aschinchon/abstractions) R experiment, we took his exploration a bit further by performing a grid search across eight parameters controlling everything from the diffusion properties to the rotation angle of the agents.
